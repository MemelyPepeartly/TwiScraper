# TwiScraper
This is a tool to get image sets ready for LoRA training data. It gets images based on tags from Twiborru and creates an equally named text file alongside them with tags both with spaces and underscores. Its a bit more manual though, if you wanna not have to put in your key every time, just update the value in config. The button to reformat the text just ensures its utf 8 for training.

All you should need to do is click the start.bat on a windows machine to setup the environment and get it running. Other OS's will need to do something else, feel free to pull request if you want to add it
